### :white_check_mark: My Portfolio Website

Live Website: https://kendallgcodes-portfolio.netlify.app/

AWS Amplify Deployed version: https://main.d2jir1qrsgu5py.amplifyapp.com/

After spending a week learning TypeScript with documentation, videos, and other learning resources, I created a Weather App with TypeScript and React, drawing data from Open Weather Map API. 

</br></br>

### :mortar_board: Main Learning Points:

- First time using Typescript to build and provision a project, so learned to take it slow and study documentation/google when needed.

- How to use types and interfaces better. 

- The value of component trees and knowing the flow of your app. 

- How amazing TypeScript is! 

- Learned about breaking the problem down, planning and tackling one bit of the app at a time. 

- Make sure to console log a lot and read errors/ not be afraid of them when they come up.
